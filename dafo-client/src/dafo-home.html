  <h1>DAFO: an ontological database system with faceted queries</h1>
<p>DAFO (<em>Data Access based on Faceted queries over Ontology</em>) is an ontological database system,
where the conceptual schema is specified as an ontology, and the extensional part is stored
in a relational database. Queries in DAFO are formulated by means of
an interactive graphical faceted interface. Queries expressible in DAFO are equivalent to concept expressions in description logic (DL).</p>
<p>In OBDA (<em>Ontology-Based Data Access</em>) systems,  queries are formulated in SPARQL,
and mappings are defined from a relational database schema to the ontological schema
using GAV (<em>Global As View</em>) approach. As a consequence, the unfolding based on mappings
can be used in query rewriting.
Like in OBDA, DAFO ontology is based on  OWL 2 QL.
In DAFO, we follow LAV (<em>Local As View</em>) approach, i.e., the ontological schema is mapped
to an underlying relational database schema.<br>
The translation process of queries into SQL is more complex than in OBDA,
but ensures more flexibility.
In faceted-based approach, a user can gradually refine her/his query using an
interactive faceted query interface. The challenging issues are then:</p>
<ul>
<li>presenting the relevant part of the underlying ontological schema in a form of a
hierarchical faceted interfaces,</li>
<li>expressiveness of faceted queries which are formulated using only click
operations on the faceted interface,</li>
<li>rewriting faceted queries into SQL.</li>
</ul>
